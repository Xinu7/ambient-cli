 * The `remember` tool — the model records a deliberate durable note into the project's curated memory
 * (`.ambient/MEMORY.md`), which compounds across sessions and is re-injected as context on the next run.
 *
 * `effects:["write"]`: it DOES write a file (`.ambient/MEMORY.md`), so it is gated by the DD-1 ladder like any
 * other write — PLAN mode (read-only) blocks it, accept-edits/bypass auto-approve it (no path ⇒ no workspace-
 * boundary friction), ask prompts. Declaring it read-only let it bypass plan-mode read-only (audit). The write
 * is best-effort; a failure never aborts the run.
