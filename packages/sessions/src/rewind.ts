 * pre-image of its EARLIEST mutation there (its content at the window boundary); a file first CREATED in the
 * window is deleted; a modify/delete whose pre-image was never checkpointed is UNRESTORABLE (never deleted).
 *
 * Purely a plan — the caller reads the blobs + touches the filesystem, and MUST conflict-check the current
 * content against `expectedNowHash` before applying (so a user's post-session edits are not silently lost).
