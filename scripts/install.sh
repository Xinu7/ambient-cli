# install.sh — install the Ambient CLI from a source checkout.
# For anyone who wants to run from source. To just install the CLI, prefer `npm i -g ambient-code`.
#
# Usage (from anywhere):   curl … | bash   is intentionally NOT supported — clone first, then run this.
#   git clone https://github.com/xinu7/ambient-cli && cd ambient-cli && ./scripts/install.sh
#
# It builds the workspace and drops an `ambient` (+ `amb`) launcher onto your PATH that points AT this clone,
# so `git pull && pnpm -r build` keeps it up to date.
