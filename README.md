# Ambient CLI

A standalone terminal coding agent for the [**Ambient**](https://ambient.xyz) decentralized-inference
network — plan, edit, run, and ship code across *every* model in Ambient's live fleet.

```bash
ambient "add input validation to the signup handler and run the tests"
```

`ambient` runs a real coding agent on Ambient models: it reads and searches your repo, edits files with
conflict-safe diffs, runs commands, verifies its work, and streams the whole thing to your terminal — under a
permission model you control. Run it with no arguments to open the interactive TUI.

## Install

Requires **Node ≥ 20.18**. No compiler needed — the CLI ships as a single pre-built JavaScript bundle.

**Homebrew** (recommended):

```bash
brew install xinu7/ambient/ambient-code
ambient                # first launch walks you through connecting your Ambient key
```

**Windows, Linux, or anywhere with Node** (npm):

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/xinu7/ambient-cli/releases/latest/download/ambient-code.tgz
ambient
```

On Windows it runs in Windows Terminal, PowerShell or the classic console. Commands run in Git Bash when it's
installed (recommended), otherwise in PowerShell — ambient tells the model which one it's using.

**From source**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xinu7/ambient-cli && cd ambient-cli
./scripts/install.sh   # builds + puts `ambient` on your PATH (~/.local/bin)
```

### Your API key

The first time you run `ambient`, it opens [app.ambient.xyz/keys](https://app.ambient.xyz/keys), asks you
to paste a key (hidden), checks it with Ambient (free — no model runs), and saves it: in the macOS keychain,
a credentials file only you can read on Linux, or encrypted with your Windows account (DPAPI) on Windows. `AMBIENT_API_KEY` in your environment also works
and takes priority.

- If a key stops working (revoked or mistyped), ambient tells you and asks for a new one right in the TUI,
  then re-runs what you asked for.
- Switch keys any time with `/login` inside ambient (or `ambient login`); `/logout` / `ambient logout`
  removes the saved key. `ambient doctor` shows which key is in use (masked) and where it came from.

Browsing the fleet (`ambient models`) and `ambient doctor` need no key. `ambient` is the primary command;
`amb` is a shorter alias.

### Update

```bash
brew upgrade ambient-code                                                                    # Homebrew
npm install -g https://github.com/xinu7/ambient-cli/releases/latest/download/ambient-code.tgz  # npm
git pull && ./scripts/install.sh                                                             # from source
```

`ambient` checks for a newer release on launch (and in `ambient doctor`) and shows the right one-line update
command for how you installed it — cached, best-effort, and never blocking. Turn it off with `AMBIENT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`
or `"checkUpdates": false` in `~/.config/amb/config.json`.

### Uninstall

```bash
brew uninstall ambient-code                # Homebrew
npm uninstall -g ambient-code              # npm
rm ~/.local/bin/ambient ~/.local/bin/amb   # from source
```

## What makes it different

- **Adapts to the live fleet.** Context window, output length, vision, tool calling and reasoning all come
  from Ambient's live model catalog, and every budget (compaction, tool output, instructions, subagent
  reports) scales with the model serving you — a 1M-context model gets proportionally more room than a 32K
  one, with no update to the CLI. Switch models mid-task with `/model`; the conversation is re-fitted to the
  new model at the next step. `ambient models` shows the whole fleet.
- **Works with *every* serveable model.** Models with native tool-calling use it directly; models without it
  are driven through a controller-assisted text protocol — not just the tool-capable ones.
- **Images for every model.** Attach a screenshot (paste a path, drag a file, or Ctrl+V). A model that can't
  see images gets it described by a vision model from the same fleet — you see it happen — and can ask
  follow-up questions about any image in the session.
- **Honest reliability.** Substitution and failover are always visible and bounded; stalled streams are
  detected and retried; network errors say what happened; the transcript is crash-safe and resumable.
- **You hold the dial.** A two-axis control — **Plan ⇄ Build** (Tab) × **ask / accept-edits / bypass**
  (Shift+Tab) — with a diff-first approval prompt and a local risk classifier.
- **Honest reasoning effort.** `auto` (default) picks per turn — none for chat, high for work, max for
  planning, hard bugs, or after a failed check; `/effort` or `--effort off|high|max` pins it. These are the
  levels Ambient models actually serve.
- **Memory you control.** Start a line with `#` to save a note to the project's memory
  (`.ambient/MEMORY.md`) without a model call; `/memory all <note>` keeps one for every project. `/memory`
  lists them and `/memory forget <n>` removes one. The agent also records what it learns there as it works.
- **A north-star you set.** `/goal` pins a session objective the agent keeps in view every turn (it survives
  compaction); the agent can propose a revision, but only you commit it.
- **Brings your setup.** Reads your existing `.claude/agents`, skills, slash commands, instruction files
  (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/rules`, with `@path` imports), and MCP
  servers (`.mcp.json`, `claude mcp add`, and Codex `config.toml`; stdio, Streamable HTTP and SSE; header or
  bearer-token auth from your environment, or OAuth sign-in with `/mcp login <server>`; their resources are
  readable and their prompts run as `/mcp__server__prompt`) so what you already use works on Ambient models. When your MCP servers bring more tools than the model has room for, it sees an index and loads
  the ones it needs on demand.
- **Hooks and permission rules, the Claude Code way.** Hook commands (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`,
  `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `PreCompact`, `Notification`)
  can block a tool call, rewrite its input, add context, or send the agent back to work. Rules like
  `Bash(npm test:*)`, `Read(./.env)`, `WebFetch(domain:docs.ambient.xyz)` or `mcp__github` allow, ask for,
  or deny matching calls (a deny always wins, even in bypass). Put both under `"hooks"` and `"permissions"`
  in `~/.config/amb/config.json`; deny and ask rules apply from any settings file.
- **Nothing from a clone runs until you say so.** A project's own `.claude/settings.json` hooks and allow
  rules and its `.mcp.json` servers apply once you've reviewed and trusted them (`/trust`, or
  `ambient trust`); any change needs trusting again. Your `~/.claude` hooks, allow rules and global
  instructions (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/rules`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) and your enabled Claude Code
  plugins' MCP servers apply when you set `"claudeSettings": true`.
- **Runs everywhere.** macOS, Linux and Windows (Git Bash or PowerShell), tested on all three.

## In the interactive TUI

The activity line narrates what the agent is actually doing — `Reading src/app.ts`, `Running pnpm test`,
`Thinking · max  ↓ 1.2k tok · 40 tok/s` — and how long it thought stays in the transcript.

```
/model [id]      switch model (also mid-task)      /compact [focus]  summarize the conversation now
/effort          auto · off · high · max           /context          how full the model's context is
/plan  /build    plan first, or just build         /usage            tokens sent and received this session
/goal <text>     a north-star kept every turn      /skills           browse and pin your skills
/attach <path>   attach an image                   /login  /logout   add, change or remove your API key
/tools           what the agent can use            /clear            start a fresh conversation
/memory          notes ambient keeps (# adds one)  /hooks            the hooks that run here
/permissions     your allow / ask / deny rules     /trust [yes]      review this project's own settings
/mcp [login <s>] your MCP servers; sign in to one
/help            every command and key             /quit
```

Keys: `↑`/`↓` previous prompts · `Ctrl+R` search them · `@` pick a file · `\` then Enter for a new line ·
`Ctrl+A/E/U/K/W` and `Alt+B/F` edit like a shell · `Ctrl+V` paste an image · `Tab` plan/build ·
`Shift+Tab` permission · `Ctrl+T` show reasoning · `Esc` stop. Your own Claude/Codex slash commands appear
in the `/` menu too. The terminal bell rings when an approval is waiting or a long run finishes
(`AMBIENT_BELL=0` turns it off).

## Architecture

A TypeScript/pnpm monorepo split into a pure **harness** and a thin terminal **shell**:

`protocol` (Zod contracts + a hash-chained event log) · `ambient-api` (catalog + SSE transport) ·
`reliability` (ready/cold, output floors, 429, overflow) · `capabilities` (evidence ladder → lane) ·
`context` (token budgeting + compaction + repo map) · `permissions` (the mode ladder + risk classifier) ·
`tools-core` (read/edit/write/grep/glob/bash + web_fetch, symlink-safe) · `sessions` (crash-safe JSONL +
rewind blobs) · `mcp` (MCP client) · `evals` (the eval ship-gate) · `runtime` (the agent state machine +
the controller-assisted lane + subagents) · `cli` (the commands + Ink TUI).

The runtime is a **pure event producer**; the TUI is a **pure event consumer** over a **pure reducer**. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the engineering standards.
